## Rolling a Pair of Dice
For this simulation, I wanted to demonstrate how --- after a sufficiently large number of rolls --- the relative frequency of an event converges to its probability.

I used the example of rolling a pair of fair dice and getting a 7. The behavior after 10M rolls is displayed below:

The blue line is the relative frequency and the orange line is the probability. We can see that after a while, the lines converge.
